# BitByBit-Faculty-Page-Redesign
Project 4

### About the Project
* This project required the team to redesign a professor's website using static site generation.
* The chosen site to redesign was Prof. Dey, a former OSU professor. The original site can be seen [here](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~dey.8/)
* The result is a fully functional, professional, HTML5/CSS compliant website. 

### Running The Program
* This project utilizes the Middleman gem. This MUST be properly installed for the website to work.
  * If you don't have Bundler installed first enter ```$ gem install bundler```
  * You can check if you have it installed by entering ```$ bundle -v```
  * Next, type ```$ bundle install``` and enter. This installs all the required Ruby gems.
  * To run the program, type ```$ middleman server``` and enter. 
  * You will receive a link once the server is running. Clicking it will navigate you to your web browser where you can view the website.
* If you want to have a local copy of all the required html and css files to run without middleman, follow these steps:
  * In the terminal, enter the command ```$ middleman build```.
  * This will create a folder named build at the same level as source which contains all files necessary to view the website.


### Project Development
* In this project, middleman was the most complicated part to understand. It took the group members several days to understand the structure and learning how to implement erb files and yml files. After understanding how middleman works, the group members efficiently distributed the project workload.
* css is also a huge challenge for this project, since there's a lot of information out there, there was much to learn. During this process, the team members learned a lot from many other websites' styles and apply the skills from W3school and eventually figured out the proper format.
* For this project, testing wasn't applicable. The group documented parts other than the plain html sentences. 
* If the team had more time, this project could be done with some other font styles import from open source website. There are also some features that are limited by javascript, because this project is only using html and css. After learning javascript, the group could potentially implement more active features towards the websites.
